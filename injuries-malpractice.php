<p><img class=" right" src="media/photos/malpractice.jpg" alt="" width="" height="">According to the Institute of Medicine, medical errors kill 98,000 Americans each year. Hundreds of thousands more are seriously injured. Studies of the pervasive problem of medical errors have also found that an estimated 3 to 4 percent of hospitalized patients received the wrong drug, dose or treatment, and that such mistakes are implicated in the death of one in 10 of these victims. (Washington Post, February 18, 2003; Page HE01)</p>
<p>Contrary to news media reports, surprisingly few claims are actually filed. Only 2% of people injured by physician's negligence seek to hold the physician accountable through a lawsuit. One reason is that medical malpractice cases are extremely expensive and time intensive.</p>
<p>Our attorneys have experience, expertise and resources to take on large HMOs and medical insurance companies to recover just compensation for our clients. We have been prosecuting these types of cases for 30 years. We represent our clients in these cases on a contingency fee basis (unless agreed otherwise) which means the client is not required to advance any costs or pay any attorney fee unless there is a recovery. It is not unusual for an attorney representing a plaintiff in a medical malpractice case to advance between $50,000 and $100,000 in expenses and spend two to three years on the case. For that reason, we can only pursue a claim against a doctor or a hospital if the injuries are profound and permanent or involve death.</p></section>
