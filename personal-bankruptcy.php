<h2>Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 Bankruptcy</h2>
<p>Our attorneys help clients obtain debt relief with a Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Chapter 7 is a debt liquidation bankruptcy which discharges credit card debts, medical bills and most other types of consumer debt.</p>
<p>Chapter 13 bankruptcy calls for the creation of a three to five-year debt repayment plan. With your Chapter 13 plan, you are only required to repay what you can afford to pay, as determined by the court. At the conclusion of your Chapter 13 payment plan, the court may also discharge remaining unsecured debts which you are unable to repay.</p>
<h2>The Automatic Stay</h2>
<p>When we file your Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition with the court, an automatic stay order will go into effect which will temporarily stop most creditors from taking any further collection activity against you, including wage garnishments, auto repossession, harassing collection calls and even home foreclosure. The automatic stay provides critical time for us to proceed with your bankruptcy case and seek the debt relief you need.</p>
<h2>Get Help — Not Judgment</h2>
<p>We are here to help. We understand that many people face difficult challenges like a job layoff, physical injury, medical condition or divorce which create significant financial challenges beyond their control.</p>
