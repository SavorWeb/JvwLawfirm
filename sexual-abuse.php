<p>If you are a survivor of sexual abuse, you have a right to hold your abuser accountable for his or her actions. What happened was not your fault, and you are not alone.</p>
<p>At James, Vernon &amp; Weeks, P.A., we are committed to pursuing legal relief on behalf of survivors of sexual abuse. We are dedicated advocates for our clients and believe strongly that taking legal action can help change institutions that have a history of covering up allegations of sexual misconduct. Based in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, we handle sexual abuse claims throughout the nation.</p>

<p>As a client of our firm, you can be confident that you are in the hands of skilled, knowledgeable and caring professionals. Our firm has been advocating passionately on behalf of injured clients since 1982.</p>
<p>Our firm has developed a reputation for skilled advocacy in sexual abuse claims. We have obtained many significant recoveries on behalf of sexual abuse survivors. We have taken on several religious institutions, the Boy Scouts of America and other prominent organizations. Attorney Leander James, a managing partner at our firm, negotiated a $166 million settlement on behalf of hundreds of sexual abuse survivors in a case against the Northwest Jesuits.</p>
<p>We realize it is difficult to reach out for help. Some of our clients have reached out to us before they have shared their history of abuse with close friends or family members. We realize these are difficult matters to discuss, and we are here to help. We are pleased to offer a free and confidential consultation to answer your questions and help you understand your rights.</p>
<h2>Legal Support For Child Sex Abuse Survivors in Minnesota</h2>
<p>A new law in the State of Minnesota called the Child Victims Act, allows victims of child sexual abuse a three-year window to seek justice even if this was not possible in the past. This new law is referred to as a window statute since it is open for only three years. Survivors of sexual abuse in Minnesota have until May of 2016 to seek healing and justice before this window is closed.</p>
